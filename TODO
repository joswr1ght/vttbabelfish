# TODO

+ Add "Captions automatically generated by vttbabelfish" to opening VTT segment
+ Check if the $ delimiter exists in the original text and if so, choose a different delimiter
+ If the platform returns translated content with a mismatched delimiter count, try again for a small number of attempts (3?)

## ChatGPT

+ Check the original text sentence beginning for capitalization and reproduce in the translated text for Latin languages
+ Check for added punctuation at the end of sentences and remove if it is not present in the text to translate
+ Sometimes ChatGPT returns a full translation of the context, not just the text to be translated, despite directives to do otherwise
