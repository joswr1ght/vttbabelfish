# TODO

+ Add "Captions automatically generated by vttbabelfish" to opening VTT segment

## ChatGPT

+ Check the original text sentence beginning for capitalization and reproduce in the translated text for Latin languages
+ Check for added punctuation at the end of sentences and remove if it is not present in the text to translate
+ Sometimes ChatGPT returns a full translation of the context, not just the text to be translated, despite directives to do otherwise
